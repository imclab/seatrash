            The current temperature is 
            $temperature
            degrees Celsius.
            The thermostat is set to $thermostat degrees Celsius.
            The air conditioner is $status.
            If you would like to change the thermostat, please enter a new setting.
            If you are satisfied, please hang up.

    	You didn't give a new setting, 
    	so the thermostat will remain at $thermostat degrees. Goodbye!
