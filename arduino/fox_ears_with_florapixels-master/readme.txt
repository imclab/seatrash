Source code for my fox ears project. I wear fox ears pretty much all the time because they're so cool! I recently made some new ones with LEDs in which can be lit up for raves and stuff. This is the source code which drives those LEDs from a digispark in my pocket. It should run fine on other arduinos and arduino compatible wearable tiny computers.
